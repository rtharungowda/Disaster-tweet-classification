# Disaster-tweet-classification

Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.<br/>
The ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency theyâ€™re observing in real-time. <br/>
Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).

Predict which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not using BERT in Tensorflow Keras <br />
